### Introduction
We mainly use google for searching ways and even tutorials on how to do something on the internet that is tech related especially in our every day task in our work. 

AI has opened many windows to it's utilization. If you have heard of github co-pilot, well you might just have the gist of how would this technology work.

How about a tool where you can get your answers directly without spending too much time reading and skimming across some website about how-to do something. You just type something like how you would ask for instrctions on a fellow team member.

***Introducing ChatGPT***

---

### Requirements for Accessing ChatGPT
- You can create an account or you can just link your google account on to the OpenAi site.

---

### Capabilities
You can use the chatGPT ai just like a chatbot. I think it's key feature is that it works like a google search engine but in the form of a chatbot. So the accuraccy of it's response and information will somehow depend on the information you are providing it.

> [!Sample]
> Enter this phrase on the chatGPT: "how many days are there in a leap year?"

Now let us get to more technical questions...
- [ ] *"how to iterate through a hashmap in java?"*

or we can ask:
- [ ] "give an example of ternary operation used with function in java"

> [!QOUTE]
> To give you demonstration on the capabilities of **ChatGPT**, let us ask some simple technical question about java programming. 
> 
> *explain how for loops work in java*


Finally, we can give it a more challenging  request: asking it to write simple code snippets for us:
- write a java code that converts normal dataTime into UTC8 format.
