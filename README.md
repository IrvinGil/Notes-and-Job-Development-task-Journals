## Decission to Use Obsidian for Note taking

The reason that is decided to use **Obsidian** is for the convenience of Logging decisions and taking notes without the hassle of organizing your notes.

With that being said the notes on here are just for decision log and notes that are involved in job tasks that are too broad to comprehend to be organized on notion pages. Hence i put them here

**Decision**: I also decided to merge the contents of my github repository (Job-Development-Task-Notes) for notes on job tasks here. This notes is also stored and hosted on github under my work account [@IrvinGil](https://github.com/IrvinGil).

## Linked pages
Linked pages only work when you use the obsidian app. And in order for this to work is that you have to enable backlinks in document options that can be found on settings.

## Vault Structure
The structure of this obsidian vault is that the organized pages that are related to each other are group under their respective folders/directory. Linked pages are just keep above those folders for easy access and to identify them as linked pages.
