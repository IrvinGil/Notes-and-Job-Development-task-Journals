The reason that is decided to use **Logteq** is for the convenience of Logging decisions and taking notes without the hassle of organizing your notes.

With that being said the notes on here are just for decision log and notes that are involved in job tasks that are too broad to comprehend to be organized on notion pages. Hence i put them here

**Decision**: I also decided to merge the contents of my github repository (Job-Development-Task-Notes) for notes on job tasks here.
