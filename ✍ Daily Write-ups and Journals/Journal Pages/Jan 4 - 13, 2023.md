[[Credits Limit]] works this way in our applications and one of the [[Business Rules]]:
1. consider a customer with [[Credits Limit]] of 90 USD. Now even if this said customer has no credit balance on their account, they can still subscribe to a plan as long as it can be covered by their credit limit (in our example: 90 USD). So a customer can subscribe to per say a 90 USD plan.
2. And for a scenario that the customer has used some of his [[Credits Limit]] by subscribing to a plan. If they wish to subscribe again to another plan or switch SMS plans. As long as they have enough credits limit, the application will allow it since it can still be covered and not reach the limit. 
3. [[Credits Limit]] can only be added by admin or with admin access to the application.

- [[Business Rules]] for plan switches(upgrade and downgrade) is that: 
	- A.) when upgrading a plan, the activation will happen immediately. 
	- B.) Whereas when downgrading a plan, activation for plan downgrade will happen on the next activation period. Example: January 6, then you want to downgrade plan. Then the activation for downgrade will happen on February 6.
