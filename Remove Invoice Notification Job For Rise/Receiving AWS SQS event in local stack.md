Here is a tutorial on how to receive an [[Amazon SQS]] message on LocalStack

Install LocalStack, which is a lightweight version of the AWS cloud stack that can be run locally on your computer. You can do this using pip:


```
pip install localstack
```

Start LocalStack in your terminal using the following command:
```
localstack start
```

In another terminal window, create an SQS queue using the AWS CLI. For example, to create a queue named "my-queue", you can run the following command:

```
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4576 sqs create-queue --queue-name my-queue
```

Send a message to your queue using the following command:
```
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4576 sqs send-message --queue-url http://localhost:4576/queue/my-queue --message-body "Hello, world!"
```

To receive the message from your queue, use the following command:

```
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4576 sqs receive-message --queue-url http://localhost:4576/queue/my-queue
```

This should output the message that you sent to the queue, along with some metadata about the message.
